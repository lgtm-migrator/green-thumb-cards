### Background

I loved playing the PC version of GTC as a kid. In May 2019, I needed an idea for a React/Node.js project for a uni course, so I decided to try out the possibilities of doing some simple game development with modern JS tools.

### How to run

* Go to the `/client` folder
* Download dependencies with `npm install`
* Run in browser with `npm start`
* Run tests with `npm test`
